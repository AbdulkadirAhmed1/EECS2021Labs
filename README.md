# Low Level Projects

## RISC-V

### Overview
The projects created in this section involve low-level programming where I write **assembly code** based on **procedural language code** (such as **C** or **Python**). These projects provide hands-on experience with the assembly language and processor architecture.

### Projects
- **Assembly Translation**: I translate high-level programming concepts (like loops and conditionals) into RISC-V assembly, closely mimicking what a compiler does manually.
  
### Visual Reference

## Verilog

### Overview
In this section, I worked on Verilog projects where I designed digital systems and processors at a very low level.

### Projects
- **CPU Design with 5 Data Paths**: I created a **CPU** with the following five main data paths:
  1. **IF (Instruction Fetch)**
  2. **ID (Instruction Decode)**
  3. **EXE (Execute)**
  4. **MEM (Memory Access)**
  5. **WB (Write Back)**

- **Cache System Design**: I developed a system that integrates multiple levels of **cache** (L1, L2, L3) to optimize the CPU's performance by minimizing memory access time.

### Highlights
- **CPU Design**: Designed a functional CPU architecture that includes all the necessary components for instruction execution.
- **Cache Design**: Implemented cache levels (L1, L2, L3) to simulate and improve data retrieval times, reflecting real-world processor cache hierarchies.
